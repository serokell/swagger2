Swagger 2.0 data model.

The original Swagger 2.0 specification is available at http://swagger.io/specification/.

## Usage

This library is intended to be used for decoding and encoding Swagger 2.0 API specifications as well as manipulating them.

Please refer to [haddock documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/swagger2).

Some examples can be found in [`examples/` directory](/examples).

## Trying out

All generated swagger specifications can be interactively viewed on [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/).

Ready-to-use specification can be served as JSON and interactive API documentation
can be displayed using [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui).

Many Swagger tools, including server and client code generation for many languages, can be found on
[Swagger's Tools and Integrations page](http://swagger.io/open-source-integrations/).
